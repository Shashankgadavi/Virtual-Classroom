# VIRTUAL CLASSROOM

A simple web-based classroom application that allows instructors to add courses with lessons, while students can enroll in these courses and track their progress. - developed using React, Node, Express and MongoDB.

Virtual Classroom is a simple online classroom application, As the world is moving to the 
internet, so are our tools for learning and acquiring knowledge in different disciplines. Right 
now, on the web, there is a plethora of online platforms that offer both educators and students 
options to teach and learn different topics remotely, without the necessity to be physically colocated in a classroom.
With this application, Educators in the Classroom can create courses and add lessons to each 
course such as adding new courses, listing courses by a specific instructor, and displaying the 
details of a single course. Each course in the MERN Classroom will contain a list of lessons 
that make up the course content and whatthe students need to coverwhen they enroll.We will
keep the lesson structure simple for this application, putting more emphasis on the
implementation of managing lessons and allowing students to go through lessons in order to
complete a course.
Once an instructor has created the course and updated itwith lessons, they willhave the option 
to publish it. Published courses will be listed on the home page, and all visitors will be able to 
view them. Once a student is enrolled on a course, they will be able to go through each lesson 
in it, and mark it complete until all the lessons are done, and the whole course is complete. 
The application will leave visual cues to let a student know the state of their enrollments in 
courses. However, the integration of educational technologies also presents challenges and 
concerns in relation to students’ learning. Online learning environments can offer learners 
opportunities for flexibility, interaction and collaboration distinctly different from face-to-face 
learning environments. The application provide is an online learning environment that allows 
for interaction between the mentor and the learners as they are participating in learning 
activities. In this type of interaction, the mentor has the particularly important role of the 
moderator who guides the learning process and supports group activities and discussions. 
Students can learn the content anywhere and anytime, there are no geographical boundaries.

The proposed solution is a web application called “VIRTUALCLASSROOM" which helpsthe 
students to overcome the problems faced in the existing system. The application provide is an 
online learning environmentthat allows for interaction between the mentor and the learners as 
they are participating in learning activities. In this type of interaction, the mentor has the 
particularly importantrole of the moderator who guidesthe learningprocess and supports group 
activities and discussions.
Students can learn the content anywhere and anytime, there are no geographical boundaries. It 
also provides preparation resources where one can view the courses and learn without any time 
restriction. those students who are very poor in economic or those who work in daytime can 
learn their course through internet from anywhere. There is no need to present physically that’s 
why name of the paper is virtual classroom system and there is no restriction. Moreover, work 
becomes very easy because there is no need to keep data on papers. There is no chance of errors
